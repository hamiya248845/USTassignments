        <p>A book is a medium for recording information in the form of <u>writing or images</u>,
             typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) 
            bound together and protected by a cover.[1] The technical term for this physical
             arrangement is codex (plural, codices). In the history of hand-held physical 
             supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, 
             the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.<u>The Street
