        Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
        implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
        programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that
        support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can
        run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is
        similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic
        capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional
        compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to
        GitHub,[citation not found][19][20] particularly for clientserver web applications, with a reported 9 million
        developers.[21]

        Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core
        component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual
        machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in
        compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java
        technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the
        official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most
        developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.
        <br><br>
        As of March 2023, Java 20 is the latest version, while Java 17, 11 and 8 are the current long-term support (LTS)
        versions.

        The syntax of Java is largely influenced by C++ and C. Unlike C++, which combines the syntax for structured,
        generic, and object-oriented programming, Java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language.[18]
        All
        code is written inside classes, and every data item is an object, with the exception of the primitive data
        types,
        (i.e. integers, floating-point numbers, boolean values, and characters), which are not objects for performance
        reasons. Java reuses some popular aspects of C++ (such as the printf method).
        <br><br>
        Unlike C++, Java does not support operator overloading[56] or multiple inheritance for classes, though multiple
        inheritance is supported for interfaces.[57]
        <br><br>
        Java uses comments similar to those of C++. There are three different styles of comments: a single line style
        marked
        with two slashes (//), a multiple line style opened with /* and closed with */, and the Javadoc commenting style
        opened with /** and closed with */. The Javadoc style of commenting allows the user to run the Javadoc
        executable to
        create documentation for the program and can be read by some integrated development environments (IDEs) such as
        Eclipse to allow developers to access documentation within the IDE.
        <br><br>
        All source files must be named after the public class they contain, appending the suffix .java, for example,
        HelloWorldApp.java. It must first be compiled into bytecode, using a Java compiler, producing a file with the
        .class suffix (HelloWorldApp.class, in this case). Only then can it be executed or launched. The Java source
        file may only contain one public class, but it can contain multiple classes with a non-public access modifier
        and any number of public inner classes. When the source file contains multiple classes, it is necessary to make
        one class (introduced by the class keyword) public (preceded by the public keyword) and name the source file
        with that public class name.
